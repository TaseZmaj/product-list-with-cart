## My process

### Built with

- CSS Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ReactMotion](https://motion.dev) - React animation library

### Continued development

In the future I want to focus on creating more reusable components, managing state the correct way as well as paying attention to the performance of the application.

### Useful resources

- [React Motion Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31y7-k3ZG0g&t=475s) this helped me when I was implementing the animations
- [React Motion Docs](https://motion.dev/docs/react-quick-start) - offical react motion documentation also helped me with the animations
- [The Ultimate React Course_2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) this is a course I'm currently enrolled at. It has greatly helped me understand the proper use of state, how to share state between components, derived state as well as key react development concepts and templates.
